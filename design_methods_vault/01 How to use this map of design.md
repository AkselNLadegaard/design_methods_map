### How to access it
You can use this notebook in 2 ways
1. Through [this website](https://publish.obsidian.md/nordvigs-map-of-design/)
2. Locally using Obsidian, by downloading/cloning [the project from Github.](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map) 

## Online vs. Local brief comparison:

### Online functions
1. Searching for methods/concepts.
2. Finding related methods/concepts in the **local graph view**
3. Clicking link/backlinks to explore related content.

### Local in Obsidian functions 
A few community plugins are used to improve the user experience.

Pretty much all commands can be found easily via search using the command pallette: *crtl+p*

1. All of the same as for the online version and: 
2. Comprehensive search functions
3. **Automatic maps/searches/views** using [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
	1. Search for tags, group them, view them as tables and so much more.
4. **Better global graph view**, *crtl+g* 
5. **Graph Presets** of filters, color coding etc. 
6. **Local graph view**, *crtl+shift+g*
7. **Juggl Graph Views**, 
	1. An alternative more structured local graph view
	2. Expand individuel notes in local graphs
8. **Open Random Notes**
9. and even more - obsidian is very flexible and expandable.
