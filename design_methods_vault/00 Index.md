# Welcome to Nordvigs map of design! 
The goal of this project is to be the most comprehensive open source map/index of methods, concepts/principles, methodologies and "maps" of design. Every method, concept/principle, methodology is a note, which can be linked to other notes. 

The main goal is relating principles and methods - not necessarily describing the methods and concepts. In its current iteration, as of 2024-02, most notes are only mentioned by name and aliases, missing: *abstract description, roots, and examples* However slowly and laboriously this content is being added.

Below you can see the animation of creating the notebook and relating entries to each other (recorded 2024-02)

## âš  Disclaimer âš 
This project is still very much work in progress - you will hit dead ends, empty notes and very short loops of notes referencing each other. If this is in an area of your expertise, please reach out to [Aksel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/) or contribute directly via Github.

### Using Nordvigs Map of Design
### How to access it
Fundamentally you can use this notebook in 2 ways
1. Through [this website](https://publish.obsidian.md/nordvigs-map-of-design/)
2. Locally using Obsidian, by downloading [the project from Github.](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map)

Locally is a lot more powerful, customizable, but requires installing [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) and to be up to date, using git 

Please note that most automatic overviews are currently not functional on the website, e.g., the double diamond map - which opened locally in Obsidian - automatically groups methods and concepts into their relevant phases. 


## How to explore the map

#### Online through the website 

1. Searching for content 
2. Through the local graph view
3. Clicking the links in the notes 
	1. Through backlinks
4. Backlinks are links/references to the note you are reading.

A great place to start exploring is: [[Facilitation]] or [[Behavioural Design]]

##### Locally through Obsidian
Pretty much all commands can be found easily through *crtl+p*

1. All of the same as for the online version and: 
2. Automatic maps/searches/views using [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
	1. This enables e.g., the [[03 Map of Double Diamond Methods ðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž]] to automatically group notes into their relevant phases, if they are tagged properly. 
3. Global graph view, *crtl+g* (with color coding!)
	1. local graph view, *crtl+shift+g*
4. Juggl Graph Views, accessible through *crtl+p*
	1. Warning only use local graph view, and then expand notes you find interesting, see [juggl.io](https://juggl.io/)  for more info
5. Open random note, *crtl+p,* search random 
	1. A super great way to finde something you don't know and find your way back.
6. and even more by installing other community plugins! 


## Credit, contributors and thanks
The project was started in late 2023 and is maintained by: [Aksel Nordvig Ladegaard ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/). The project builds upon their notetaking in Obsidian from their time at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/design-and-innovation) studying design in an engineering context. 

Please contribute to it via its [Github repository ](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map)

A big thanks to members of Design for Societal Change, an alumni group of mostly design engineers from DTU from the study line Design & Innovation. (Their digital presence is "under construction")
