# Welcome to Nordvigs map of design! 
The goal of this project is to be the most comprehensive map/index of methods and concepts  of design. 

Every method, concept/principle is a note, which can be linked to other notes. All the notes can be explored by jumping through the links or as an interactive graph. The project is made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and is inspired by digital gardens.  

The main goal is relating principles and methods, to make it easy to explore related design methods/concepts. It is not the goal to describe the methods/concepts in depth - but to offer reference to other materials. You can think of it as an interactive rolodex/index of design. 

The hope is that this will be useful for design practitioners (designers, engineers, innovators problem solvers, consultants etc.) to easily explore the somewhat scattered universe of design. 

A few good notes to visit to get the idea: [[Double Diamond]] or [[Behavioural Design]] or [[Facilitation]] 


Below you can see the animation of creating the notebook and relating entries to each other (recorded 2024-02-25)

## ⚠ Disclaimer ⚠
This project is very much work in progress - you will hit empty notes and very short loops of notes referencing only each other. If you want to contribute, please reach out to [Aksel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/) or contribute directly through the repository on github.

A lot of options are not available in the web version. there are vastly more options for exploring the contents by accessing it locally in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).  See [[01 How to use this map of design]] for a more detailed comparison.

## How this map is structured
There are:
1. **Maps**, are notes list and group concepts and methods for a specific view of design - *circular design, double diamond, stakeholder engagement* 
2. **Concepts**, are principles/concepts - *affordance, analogies, cognitive biases, collaboration*
3. **Methods**, are ways of ideating, analyse, evaluate, etc - *SWOT, stakeholder mapping, fishbone diagrams, FMEA, LCA, brainstorming, PEST* 

There are several types of **maps:** 
1. **Designs** - circular design, ecodesign, business model design, game design
2. **Models of design** - *Double diamond, N-model*
3. **Frameworks**, - *Action framework, BIO triz, behavioural design framework*
4. **Topics**, which are recurring elements in design processes and projects - *stakeholder engagement, conflict resolution, interviews, simulation, prototyping*
5. **Tag panes** - searches of specific tags, e.g., phase/diverging, goal/analyse
6. **Overviews**, which are list of ALL concepts, methods and similar.

See [[02 Design map structure, principles and thoughts]] for further details.
## What is in the project?
- Several overviews of design have been manually added, see [[00 Index#Inspirational work]]s
- Most methods/concepts are only mentioned by names, and generally also aliases. 
- Most notes are missing: description, tagsand links to other notes. - but it is being added.
- A few semi-automatic overviews are accessible online, see:  [[Double Diamond]].
	- A lot of methods are not yet tagged to be indexed in the double diamond. If you run this project locally, you can explore predefined and custom views of all the content.

## Credit, contributors and thanks
The project was started in late 2023 and is maintained by: [Aksel Nordvig Ladegaard ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/). The project builds upon their notetaking in Obsidian from their time at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/design-and-innovation) studying Design & Innovation. Please contribute to it via its [Github repository ](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map)

A big thanks to members of *"Design for Societal Change Thursdays Club"*, an alumni group of mostly design engineers from DTU from the study line Design & Innovation. (Our digital presence is under construction)
