# Welcome to Nordvigs map of design! 
The goal of this project is to be the most comprehensive open source map/index of methods, concepts/principles, methodologies and "maps" of design. Every method, concept/principle, methodology is a note, which can be linked to other notes. All the notes can be explored as an interactive graph. 
The project is made using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can is inspired by digital gardens.  

The main goal is relating principles and methods, to make it easy to explore related design methods/concepts. It is not necessarily the goal to deeply describe the methods/concepts in depth - but to offer reference to other materials. You can think of it as an interactive index of design. 

The hope is that this will be useful for design practitioners (designers, engineers, innovators problem solvers - almost everyone is a designer, structured or not!) to easily explore the somewhat scattered universe of design methods. 

A few good notes to visit to get the idea: [[Double Diamond]] or [[Behavioural Design]] or [[Facilitation]]

## What is in the project?
- Several overviews of design methods, concepts and principles have been manually added, see [[00 Index#Inspirational work]]s
	- See the methods or concept folder to get an idea of the scope.
- Most methods/concepts are only mentioned by names, and generally also aliases. 
- Most notes are missing: description, tagsand links to other notes. 
- A few semi-automatic overviews are accessible online, see:  [[Double Diamond]].
	- A lot of methods are not yet tagged to be indexed in the double diamond. If you run this project locally, you can explore predefined and custom views of all the content.

## ⚠ Disclaimer ⚠
This project is still very much work in progress - you will hit dead ends, empty notes and very short loops of notes referencing each other. If you want to contribute, please reach out to [Aksel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/) or contribute directly through the repository on github.

A lot of options are not available in the web version. there are vastly more options for exploring the contents as suits you by accessing it locally.

### Using Nordvigs Map of Design
### How to access it
You can use this notebook in 2 ways
1. Through [this website](https://publish.obsidian.md/nordvigs-map-of-design/)
2. Locally using Obsidian, by downloading/cloning [the project from Github.](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map) and opening the contents as a Vault. 
	1. Enabling community plugins enhances the experience considerably. 

## How to explore the map
#### Online through the website 
1. Searching for content 
2. Through the local graph view
3. Clicking the links in the notes 
	1. Through backlinks
4. Backlinks are links/references to the note.

A great place to start exploring from could be: [[Double Diamond]], [[Facilitation]] or [[Behavioural Design]]

##### Locally through Obsidian
Pretty much all commands can be found easily through *crtl+p*
1. All of the same as for the online version and: 
2. Automatic maps/searches/views using [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
3. Global graph view, *crtl+g* (with color coding!)
	1. local graph view, *crtl+shift+g*
	2. In the left sidebar 
4. Juggl Graph Views, accessible through *crtl+p*
	1. Warning only use local graph view, and then expand notes you find interesting, see [juggl.io](https://juggl.io/)  for more info
5. Open random note, *crtl+p,* search random 
6. and even more by installing other community plugins! 
## Credit, contributors and thanks
The project was started in late 2023 and is maintained by: [Aksel Nordvig Ladegaard ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akselnladegaard/). The project builds upon their notetaking in Obsidian from their time at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/graduate/msc-programmes/design-and-innovation) studying Design & Innovation. 

Please contribute to it via its [Github repository ](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map)

A big thanks to members of Design for Societal Change, an alumni group of mostly design engineers from DTU from the study line Design & Innovation. (Their digital presence is "under construction")
