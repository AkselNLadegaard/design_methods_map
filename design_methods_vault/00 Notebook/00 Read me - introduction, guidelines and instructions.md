The goal of this obsidian notebook is to be a living collection of design methods, concepts and methodologies, with descriptions, examples and relation to other methods, concepts and methodologies. 

This is further enhanced by Obsidians amazing "Graph view" which allows us to create views like this, to explore relevant concepts and methods, when looking for the right tool for the job.

// Insert graph view here 

// Insert local graph view here 


You can use this notebook in two different ways
1. Online through // insert linked // 
	1. This has not yet been implemented but the plan is to use https://obsidian.md/publish
2. Clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/AkselNLadegaard/design_methods_map) and browse it locally with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Obsidian 
If you decide to use the notebook with Obsidian which we highly recommend, as it is a neat tool, and it allows you to contribute your amazing insights, then there is a little bit of a learning curve. For in obsidian pretty much anything is possible, but some things might be a little unintuitive. 

But please refer to the the documentation and help directly from Obisidan, here: https://help.obsidian.md/Home or reach out to one of the maintainers.


## How to contribute 
We would love for you to add methods, concepts, links, tagging etc.. to contribute do the following: 
1. Install git
2. Clone the github repository
3. Open it with obsidian 
	1. For some features you have to enable community plugins in settings
4. Create a new branch with a relevant name
5. Make your changes, adding methods etc.
6. Commit your changing 
7. Push your changes 
8. Create a pull request 
9. Get your contributions reviewed, potential changes 
10. Your contributions gets accepted and merged into the main branch

**Git is a little daunting at first, but it is for now the best way of managing this project. There are countless guides on the internet, videos etc.. explaining how to od it, if you get stuck try a chatbot (chatgpt, bard or similar) or reach out to one of the maintainers**
For 99% of the use cases all you need is: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging 


## How to add a design method/concept/methodology or similar

1. Create a new file 
2. Input the relevant template (default keybaord shortcut is crtl+p and then search insert template)
3. Fill it out! 


Pleas remember to 
1. tag it relevantly! 
2. Link it to relevant concepts and methods, even if they haven't been written yet!


# Meanderings and thoughts on figuring out how to structure this 
## Ways of structuring design methods 

~~The basis for organizing information and a knowledge base is taxonomy and mapping. Please keep this in mind when viewing the content and adding links and information to the notebook.~~ The value of this notebook comes not only form the content, but the relations and categorisation of the design knowledge.

From Goolge Bard (AI, LLM):
**Taxonomy** is a system of organizing and classifying information based on the relationships between concepts and terms. Taxonomies can be hierarchical, with concepts arranged in a tree-like structure, or non-hierarchical, with concepts connected in a web-like network.

**Mapping** involves relating two or more taxonomies or knowledge structures. This can be done by creating links between corresponding terms or concepts in different taxonomies. Mapping is useful for improving the interoperability of different systems and enabling users to find information across different sources. ( // rewrite)

**Taxonomy** and **mapping** are essential tools for information management. They can help to improve the organization, accessibility, and interoperability of information.


We can categorise  design methods by
* Design phase
* Design methodology 
* By form of data 
	* Quantitative 
	* Qualitative
* Duration?
* Creative approach 
	* Analytical 
	* Generative 
	* Experimental
* Origin?
* 




Categorising and organizing notes  in obsidian
1. Links: 

You can use brackets to make a link to another note, it opens a really nice search function making it easy. You can also link to a note that has not been written yet, then when it is written the link becomes active! 
```
[[link to a note goes here]]

Use double square brackets: []
```
and it then looks like [[00 Read me - introduction, guidelines and instructions]]

Protip, hover and press crtl (or change they shortcut) to preview the ocnten of the note ;) 

2. Tags 


3. Folders (with a little caution please)

Why can't you just use folders?

1. Folders are hierarchal 
	1. This forces invariably leads to either either: duplication of notes or a single insufficient taxonomy. 
	3. Hierarchy conflicts with the the purpose of this 'database'/notebook which is to support multiple different taxonomies of design without duplication of notes.  

But some hierarchy is necessary for making this maintainable so:

**When can you use folders to organise notes into:**
	1. Description
	2. Concepts
	3. Methods
	4. Methdologies 
	5. Templates

1. **Description:** is for notes like this, describing the purpose of the notebook, how to use it and other "meta" stuff

2. **Concepts**, is for different concepts (especially design concepts), for example [[Redundancy]]  


3. **Methods**: is for design methods, like [[Service blueprint]] 

4. **Methodologies**: are for the overarching frameworks and approaches that govern design, like eco-design, agile design
5. **Templates**: are for small outlines for how to use some methods, there can be multiple templates per concept, method or methodology
