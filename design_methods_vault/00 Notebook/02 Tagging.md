## Adapted from 100 principles and 100 methods

These tagging and categorisations are adapted from 100 principles and 100 methods of design. 
```

"How can I influence the way a design is perceieved"
#perception


"How can I help people learn from a desing?"
#learnability


"How can I enhance the eusability of a design?"
#usability 


"Hwo can I increase the appeal of a design?"
#aesthetics 

"How can I make better design decisions?"
#decisionMaking


```
100 methods categorise design methods using: 
1. Planning Scoping and Definition
2. Exploration Synthesis and Design Implications 
3. Concept Generation and Early Prototype iteration 
4. Evaluation, Refinement and Production 
5. Launch and Monitor 

Considering already defined tags, only ``` #goal/monitor``` is necessary to add
