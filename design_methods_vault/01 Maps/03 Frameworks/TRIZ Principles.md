A map of triz principles, mostly taken from and inspired by https://www.triz40.com/aff_Principles_TRIZ.php all credit to them. 
- We will not use their descriptions, just their overview to enrich the obsidian vault. 

## Principles
- [[Segmentation]]
	- [[Taking out]] might remove this one 
- [[Local quality]]
- [[Asymmetry]]
- [[Merging]] 
- [[Universality]] make it perform multiple functions
- [[Nested doll]]
- [[Anti-weight]]
- [[Preliminary anti-action]]
- [[Preliminary action]]
	- There's also beforehand cushioning but arguably it is a subset of the two above IMO
- [[Equipotentiality]]
- [[Spheroidality - Curvature]]
- [[Dynamics]] might remove this one 
- [[Mechanical vibration]]
- [[Periodic action]]
- [[Continuity of useful action]] -- should possibly be renamed to 
- [[Skipping]]
- [[It is not a bug it is a feature]]
- [[Feedback]]
- [[Self service]]
- [[Copying]]
- [[Mirroring]]
- [[Substitution]]
- [[Thin films]]
- [[Flexible shells]]
- [[Embedded pneumatics and hydraulics]]
- [[Porous materials]] might change to porousity, posb with alias
- [[Color change]] might remove
- [[Homogeneity]]
- [[Discarding]] and [[Recovering]]
- [[Parameter Variation]]
- [[Phase transition]]
- [[Thermal expansion]]
- [[Strong oxidants]]
- [[Inert]] 
- [[Composite]]
