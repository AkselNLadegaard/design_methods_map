## Description
The 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, suggests that roughly s80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. This principle highlights the uneven distribution of effects across contributing factors, encouraging efforts to be focused on the "vital few".

## Examples 
- 80% of a company's profits may come from 20% of its customers.
- 80% of website traffic might come from 20% of its pages.
- 80% of bugs in software often cause 20% of crashes.
- 80% of learning gains in a language course might come from 20% of the studied material.
