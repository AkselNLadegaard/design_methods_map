## Description
All policy design is inherently related to [[Behavioural Design]].

Regulation and policy can be categorized in various ways, depending on the desired perspective. Here are some common approaches:

**By Level of [[Authority]]:**

- **[[Statutory instruments]]:** These are binding rules created by legislative bodies, like parliaments.
- **[[Subordinate legislation]]:** Made by government agencies based on powers granted by legislation, often focusing on specific details.
- **[[International agreements]]:** Treaties and conventions between countries establishing common rules or frameworks.
- **[[Self-regulatory standards]]:** Created by industry groups or professional bodies to guide conduct, often voluntary but sometimes influential.

**By Policy Area:**

- **[[Economic regulation]]:** Governs aspects like competition, consumer protection, and market integrity.
- **[[Social regulation]]:** Aims to protect public health, safety, and welfare, covering areas like environmental protection, food safety, and labour standards.
- **[[Cultural regulation]]:** Regulates media, arts, and intellectual property, balancing creative freedom with public concerns.
- **[[Security regulation]]:** Deals with national security, terrorism prevention, and border control.

**By [[Policy Instrument]]:**

- **[[Command-and-control regulations]]:** Set specific rules and obligations that entities must follow.
- **[[Market-based instruments]]:** Use economic incentives like taxes, subsidies, or trading schemes to achieve policy goals.
- **[[Information-based instruments]]:** Provide transparency and public disclosure to influence behaviour.
- **[[Voluntary approaches]]:** Encourage desired behaviour through collaboration, education, or incentives without mandatory rules.

**Other Frameworks:**

- **Precautionary vs. reactive:** Precautionary policies anticipate and prevent risks, while reactive ones address problems after they occur.
- **Top-down vs. bottom-up:** Top-down approaches are created centrally and imposed, while bottom-up involve consultation and stakeholder participation.
- **Centralized vs. decentralized:** Centralized policies are managed by a single authority, while decentralized ones involve multiple actors at different levels.
