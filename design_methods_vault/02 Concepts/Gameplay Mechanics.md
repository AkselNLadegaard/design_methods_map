Mechanics creates gameplay, so I merged the notes for cohesion and avoid overlap with mechanical engineering stuff. Subject to change

Mostly by [[Google bard 2024]]

**Basic Mechanics:**

- **[[Turns]]:** Players take turns performing actions (e.g., chess, turn-based strategy).
- **[[Action points]]:** Players have a limited number of actions/ability per turn/period
- **[[Resource management]]:** Players collect and manage resources to achieve goals.
- **[[Movement]]:** Players move characters or objects around the game space.


- **[[Destruction]]/Combat**: Players engage in battles or conflicts (e.g., fighting games, RPGs).
- **[[Creation]]/Building/construction:** Players create structures or objects (e.g., Minecraft, city builders).

- **Puzzle solving:** Players manipulate objects or solve logical challenges (e.g., Portal, puzzle games).

- **Progression:** Players gain experience, unlock new abilities, and advance through the game (e.g., role-playing games, roguelikes).

- [[Randomness]] and
	- [[Chances]] 
	- **Dice rolling:** Introduce randomness and risk/reward (e.g., board games, RPGs).
	- [[Gambling]]
	- **Card drafting/drawing:** Players acquire and use cards with unique abilities (e.g., Dominion, deck-building games).
- **[[Area control]]:** Players compete for dominance over specific regions (e.g., Risk, territorial control games).
- **[[Social deduction]]:** Players attempt to uncover hidden identities (e.g., Werewolf, Among Us).
- [[Secrecy]]
	- **Hidden movement:** Players move characters secretly and reveal them strategically (e.g., Fog of War).
- [[Real time]]
	- **Real-time strategy (RTS):** Players issue commands and manage resources in real-time (e.g., StarCraft, Age of Empires).
- **[[Sandbox]]:** Players are free to explore and experiment with gameplay possibilities (e.g., Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto).

**Additionally:**

- **[[Time limits]]:** Add pressure and urgency 
- **Randomization:** Creates variety, challenges and enhances [[Replayability]] 
- **[[Narrative choices]]:** Players influence the story through their decisions.
- **Skill-based mechanics:** Reward precise timing, execution or similar (e.g., fighting games, rhythm games).
- **Emergent gameplay:** Unforeseen interactions between mechanics create unique experiences.
