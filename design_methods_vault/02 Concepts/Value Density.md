## Description
**Value density** refers to the **quantifiable relationship between the value of a product and its physical volume or weight**. It is a key metric used in various contexts, particularly **product design, logistics, and supply chain management**. 
Bard argues: It reflects the **efficiency and cost-effectiveness** of transporting, storing, and handling products based on their inherent value.

- Value density can also be used in other contexts and abstractly
	- E.g., the value density of a webpage? Event?
