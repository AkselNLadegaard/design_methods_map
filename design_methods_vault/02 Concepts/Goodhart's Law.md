## Description
Goodhart's Law states that **when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.** In simpler terms, focusing solely on one metric to achieve a goal can lead people to optimize for that metric at the expense of other important aspects, ultimately distorting the original intent and potentially causing unintended consequences.
