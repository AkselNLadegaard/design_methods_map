## Description
Socio-technical systems (STS) recognizes the dynamic interdependence between social and technical elements within any system. This approach acknowledges that technology doesn't exist in a vacuum, but is deeply embedded in social contexts and shapes both human behaviour and organizational structures. Understanding and designing STS effectively requires considering both sides of the equation. #notebook/ai/google/gemini/2024
