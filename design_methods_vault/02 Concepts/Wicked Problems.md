## Description
- Wicked problems are complex, interconnected issues with no single, definitive solution. They are constantly evolving, with incomplete or contradictory information, rmaking any attempts at resolution susceptible to unintended consequences. (Google Gemini, 2024)

I really enjoy this tabular format from [Pyykkö, Harri, Mari Suoheimo, and Stefan Walter. 2021](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/12/2135)

|Points|Definitions|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|“There is no definite formulation of a wicked problem.”|
|2|“Wicked problems do not have a “final solution” because the resolution can always be improved.”|
|3|“Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good or bad.”|
|4|“There is neither a final test nor an immediate solution to a wicked problem.”|
|5|“Each solution tentative to a wicked problem is a one-time operation and each attempt counts significantly.”|
|6|“Wicked problems do not have enumerable sets of potential (or exhaustively descriptive) solutions.”|
|7|“Each wicked problem is essentially unique.”|
|8|“Each wicked problem can be considered a symptom of another problem.”|
|9|“The existence of discrepancies in the representation of a wicked problem can be explained in several ways. Choosing an explanation determines the nature of the problem resolution.”|
|10|“The planner has no right to be wrong, because there are consequences.”|
