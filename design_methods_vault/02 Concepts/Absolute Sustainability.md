## A non academic description
A product/service can achieve absolute sustainability by only emitting less than its allocated portion of the planetary boundaries.

- Societal activities needs not to exceed the planetary boundaries and meet social needs, i.e., the [[Donut economy]] model of sustainability. 
	- Society therefore needs many different products and services to meet social needs. 
	- How can we split up the donut "budget to each type of product/service?
		- Are some are more important than others? 
		- Is food more important than computers? 
			- Does computers enable us to produce more food, more sustainably? It is not a zero sum game and remember a planet has a [[Carrying capacity]]. 
		- One method is economic allocation, where current economic expenditure on a service/product on a societal level is used to indicate the importance.
