## Description

**In relation to accessibilitiy and universal design**
- Instead of framing disabilities, which is prone to fixation on stereotypes of disabilities, e.g., wheelchairs. Focusing on abilities is generally a more fruitful way of identifying issues in ones concept. 
	- Instead of asking: who does this exclude? You can ask: what abilities does this require.
	- **Instead of:** "Who does this website exclude?" (Focuses on exclusion)
	- **Try:** "What abilities are required to navigate this website?" (Focuses on usability)
