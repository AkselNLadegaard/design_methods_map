## Description
Modules are self-contained, independent units of functionality within a larger system. They encapsulate data and logic, and interact with other modules through well-defined interfaces. Modular design promotes abstraction, reusability, and simplifies understanding and management of complex systems #notebook/ai/google/gemini/2024
