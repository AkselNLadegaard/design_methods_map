## Description
- As a thinking tool for designers:
	- Chunking up - making it more abstract
	- Chunking down - making it more specific, or going down a branch of the map/tree

- Breaking something into smaller manageable units, like grouping a form to organise it. 
- 

## Examples 
**Hierarchical map:** Chunking is like creating a detailed map of information, with different levels of zoom. Start with a high-level overview, then drill down into specific areas for deeper exploration.
