- An overview of design method/concept names is valuable if navigable.
- Most current overviews are limited by being domain specific, e.g., UX focused, product design focused, universal design focused

## What to include 
- Methods
- General concepts and principles
- General design disciplines or areas, e.g., requirements engineering, circular design 
- Frameworks 
	- Recipes for doing design, preferably a bit generalized. E.g., do some of these methods, consider these specific factors, follow this table etc..
- Models
	- Abstract/research models of design, e.g., structuring design by phases, abstraction levels 

## What not to include
- History, People, Products/services
	- Exceptions are possibly ok. But this is not a Wikipedia. 
- Duplicate methods/concepts
	- Many methods are known by many names, add the synonym to the general method. 
	- We cannot include everything.

## Use of AI and LLMs
This is done some places but always tagged. All AI content is read through and edited for brevity. If you find descriptions wrong, missing or otherwise subpar - please help contribute!
For now it is not the goal to be any form of authoritative/correct/exhaustive definition of concepts/methods - but to give a general overview when exploring the map. 

Google Gemini has been the main LLM of use as of 202402. Notes/areas where this has been used are tagged  #notebook/ai and by their LLM #notebook/ai/google/gemini/2024  and year.

## On expanding the map
Opening a random note is a good way of limiting bias in which notes to expand and create more disparate paths through the notebook.
### Interlinking 

### Overlinking 
- Some concepts are always relevant - linking to these should be minimized to some extent, e.g., behaviour, economy, 
	- Some of these might have a tag to use instead! 
- Current Tag Pages are created for the web view but have to be updated manually and cause overlinking.
	- e.g., all methods having a backlink to a note they have a tag for, i.e., phase/discover
	- In most graph presets these are filtered out.

## The Web View / website
No filtering in the graph view and backlinking creates a lot of issues. As more Maps are added and filled out, there will be a lot of overlinking, severely increasing the cognitive load when exploring. Hopefully some of these problems are addressed in future updates of Obsidian.md/publish
