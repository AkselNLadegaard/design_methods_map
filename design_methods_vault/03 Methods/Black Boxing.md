## Description
Purposefully ignoring the details of how a certain element of a system works, by only looking at its generalized inputs and outputs. 

Black boxing is very often done without thoughts from the practitioners, for example:
1. When making a [[Wireframe]] the designer typically completely disregards how the software should be made, as the focus is on the user experience. 
2. When explaining a complex system, e.g., in a flow chart, like a [[Service blueprint]] each flow chart block, is a black box 

Questions for the reader:
1. [ ] Are all explanations black boxes? What is not a black box? Is a fundamental mathematical axiom a black box? 

## Examples 


## Related notes 
- [[Functional Decomposition]] and [[Function Mean trees]] can be viewed as levels of black boxing
