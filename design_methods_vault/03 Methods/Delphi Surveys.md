## Description
A Delphi survey is a qualitative research method that seeks to gather and synthesize expert opinion on a specific topic. It is typically conducted in multiple rounds, with each round providing participants with an anonymized summary of the previous round's responses. This allows participants to refine their opinions and identify areas of consensus or disagreement. [[Google bard 2024]]
