## Description
- A qualitative method where designers/users draw insights from existing artefacts/services. 
	- Typical outputs can be A3/slides with pictures of the object/product in question with call outs, pros/cons and similar
	- [[Product Reviews]] are a form of artefact analysis 

* Artefact analysis can have very different focuses, and goals. 

* Think of it as "Interviewing products"
	* Ideally you have planned and prepared an [[Interview Guides]] and research method, i.e.,
		* Selection of products 
		* Documentation procedure 
		* Analysis/interpretation guide 
		* Comparison and metrics 
	* Remember to reflect on your bias! A lot of accessibility oriented products may appear very silly/ill-designed if not viewed from an accessibility angle
