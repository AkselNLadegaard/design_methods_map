## Description
**DEMATEL** is a multi-criteria decision-making method that helps **visualize and analyze the cause-and-effect relationships** among complex sets of factors or criteria. 
It involves pair-wise comparisons by experts to assess the direct and indirect influences between factors, resulting in a **visual representation** of their causal structure. 
This can be used to identify **critical factors, prioritize actions, and understand the overall dynamics of a complex system**.

## Examples 
- From identifying drivers of customer satisfaction to analyzing the casual relationships between environmetnal, economic and social factors in sustainability assesments. 
- Prioritizing development activities in a product roadmap based on their impact on other features.
