## Description
A hierarchal breakdown, visualised as a tree, of how to achieve different functions by different means.

This allows easy exploration of the [[Solution Space]] 


Questions for the reader:
- Do you need to visualize it? How would you do it in other formats
## Examples 


## Related notes 
- [[Functional  Analysis]]
- [[Value Engineering]] in the sense of identifying which functions to what means are the most important
- [[Morphology]] as a morphology in some sense maps different goals/functions and lists means (solutions) for achieving these 
- [[Functional Decomposition]]
- [[Objective Trees]]
- [[Functional allocation]] is the act of assigning specific functions to [[Modules]]
