## Description
- Pick a topic or set of topics 
- Write each topic on a piece of paper 
- Set a timer, for e.g., 1 minute
- Everyone writes for one minute on the topic
	- Various forms exist, no drawing allowed, diagramming allowed and drawing only, to name a few
- the paper is then passed around clockwise
- Time is set again, possibly a different duration
- Everyone continues developing the others idea/thoughts 
- This is done until everyone has had the chance to contribute to every idea 


**Facilitation can be important to drive participation in later rounds**
- Silence is key, to avoid participants influencing each other too much
- Change seating, to mix up the type of developments of ideas participants 
- Make sub groups if you are lucky enough to have a lot of participants/subjects 
- Have themes or topics
	- Write down only positive aspects 
	- What would be cost implications of this 

- Only do idea development
