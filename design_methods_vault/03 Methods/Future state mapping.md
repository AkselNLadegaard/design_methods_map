## Description
Future State Mapping is a tool used to envision and explore future states for a process, system, or experience. It involves understanding the current state, identifying pain points and opportunities, and then brainstorming and visualizing an ideal future scenario.

- It is akin to [[TO BE]] and [[AS IS]] terminology.
