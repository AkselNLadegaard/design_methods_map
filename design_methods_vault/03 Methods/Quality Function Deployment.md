## Description
**Quality Function Deployment (QFD)** is a customer-centric methodology used to **translate customer needs and desires into detailed technical specifications** for product development. It emphasizes **capturing the "Voice of the Customer" (VOC)** and ensures that product features and functionalities directly address customer priorities. QFD utilizes a matrix-based approach, often visualized as the **"House of Quality,"** to facilitate this translation and align various stages of the development process.
