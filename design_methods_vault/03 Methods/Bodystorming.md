## Description
Bodystorming provides a unique opportunity to empathize with your target audience by physically simulating their actions and interactions with your design. This embodied experience allows you to uncover hidden pain points, identify potential usability issues, and gain a deeper understanding of their preferences and expectations. #notebook/ai/google/bard

- Use props! 
- Staging and proper facilitation is required. 
- How do you plan on capturing the outputs of the exercise? 
- You can bodystorm on location! 
	- If you are working with a festival - try bodystorming at various campsites and locations 

Questions for the reader?
1. Is bodystorming prototyping, why/why not? How would you achieve the same with prototyping methods? 
## Examples 


## A detailed guide 
Thanks to #notebook/ai/google/bard for helping:
1. **Select Specific Topics:** Choose one or two key themes from your affinity map that you want to explore in more depth through bodystorming. These themes should represent areas where you want to gain deeper insights into user interactions and potential design challenges.
2. **Create Character Profiles:** Develop character profiles based on your affinity map findings. These profiles should represent your target users, including their characteristics, goals, and challenges.
3. **Determine Scenarios:** Craft scenarios for each selected theme based on the character profiles you created. These scenarios should represent realistic situations where users would interact with your product or service.
4. **Set the Stage:** Design a physical space that resembles the context of your scenarios. This could involve using props, furniture, or even simple markings to create the desired environment.
5. **Bodystorming Session:** Divide your team into groups of 2-4 people. Assign each group a scenario and ask them to bodystorm the scenario, embodying the characters and their actions.
6. **Physical Exploration:** Encourage participants to physically explore the space, using their bodies and gestures to represent the user interactions described in the scenario.
7. **Observation and Discussion:** Observe the bodystorming sessions and facilitate discussions afterward. Encourage participants to reflect on their experiences and identify any potential problems, opportunities, or insights.

- [[Roleplaying]]
- As is evident form its name, it is akin to [[Brainstorming]], especially more structured brainstorming approaches where participants 'roleplay'. For example see: [[De Bono's six thinking hats]]
