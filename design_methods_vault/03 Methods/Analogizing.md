## Description
- Comparing two things to transfer/relate/translate/reframe [[Mental Model]] in the desired context.
	- [[Reframing]] can be especially powerful, e.g.,: *"instead of thinking of >insert party area< as a dangerous crime ridden area where the darn youth hangs out - think of it as a weekly festival!"* 
	  
- Analogizing can avoid teaching/explaining a whole new domain, by adapting users/actors existing mental models, e.g., describing triple bottom line or ESG as "Climate accounting" to an accountant. 

- The reason to analogize can be to reduce the [[Cognitive Load]], e.g., by using a mental model that the user already have, they can:
	- Infer/assume functionality 
	- Predict behavior 
	  
- The dangers with analogizing is that it is a simplification, all analogies are - and it will break down. Tragic examples:
	- [ ] Engineers being taught that the economy is like water infrastructure. This inherently doesn't work due to concepts such as inflation (Aksel/you should revise this section 20240122 and add citation to Donut Economics // Gode Penge or original source)
	- Electricity as water - some more complicated phenomena does not behave like water, or require a lot of effort to fit into an existing [[Analogy]].
