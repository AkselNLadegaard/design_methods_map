## Description
- Comparing two things to transfer/relate/translate/reframe [[Mental Model]] in the desired context. 

- Analogizing can help explain a new domain, by building/reframing on users existing mental models.

- The reason to analogize can be to reduce the [[Cognitive Load]], e.g., by using a mental model that the user already have, they can:
	- Infer/assume functionality 
	- Predict behaviour 
	  
- Analogies can be dangerous as they all are abstractions and simplifications leading to wrongly predicted behaviour.
	- E.g., electrical circuits as water breaks
