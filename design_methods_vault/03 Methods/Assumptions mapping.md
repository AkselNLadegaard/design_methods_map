## Description
- Throughout the design and life cycle of products, services & problems, assumption accumulate and become second nature to the involved stakeholders 
- Assumption Mapping attempts to gather, visualize and categorize assumptions to open up the problem & solution space. 

- Assumptions may become irrelevant over time 
- Assumptions may be inherently false. 
- Assumptions may only be true/false for some actors/stakeholders in the actor network.

### Procedure
1. Write down all assumptions,
	1. e.g., be inspired by doing a [[Walking The Wall]] with the express purpose of finding assumption. Or just [[Brainstorming]]
2. Decide on a set of axis to map along
	1. Importance vs. certainty
		1. Importance for the product/service/problem under study 
		2. Certainty of the assumption
3. Categorize
	1. What themes are there
	2. Which are important and uncertain, can they be investigated/evaluated to reduce the uncertainty 


## Examples 
- **Traditionally** assumption mapping maps
