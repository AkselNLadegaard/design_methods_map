## Description
Framing is how something is perceived, interpreted and understood - generally influenced by how it is presented. 


## Examples 
- Framing a problematic violent party street as a festival instead of a crime problem
	- Suddenly many solutions seem obvious as many festival needs are unmet on the party street. 
		- E.g., social workers that help party goes instead of only police enforcement.
