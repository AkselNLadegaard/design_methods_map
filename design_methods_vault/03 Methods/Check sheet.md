## Description
A check sheet is a simple data collection tool to systematically observe, record, and possibly structure and/or analyse an event.

- Not to be confused with a checklist which is a UI element. A check sheet is distinct in being a form, paper for "recording" observations, and/or procedures.
- As check sheets provides a structure for the user (the observer(s)), they may adhere to much to the structure, and thus not report other important behaviour or follow up on specific instructions. See [[Protocol Analysis]] and [[Protocols]] 
## Examples 
- **[[Tally sheets]]:** Focus on counting the frequency of specific events.
- **[[Attribute checklists]]:** List predefined characteristics to mark their presence or absence.
- **[[Observation grids]]:** Organize observations across multiple dimensions (e.g., users, tasks, contexts).
- [[Forms]] - in UI UX design these can be thought of as Digital Check Sheets. Especially in business/admin UI's where e.g., a healthcare worker fills out a a standard form (check sheet) for a patient 
- To some extent: [[Instructions]] and [[Manuals]]
