## Description
"**Cause-effect chains (CECs)** are visual tools that help you organize and understand the relationships between causes and effects. They are often used to identify the root cause of a problem or to develop solutions. CECs can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Troubleshooting:** Identifying the root cause of a problem
- **Problem prevention:** Identifying potential problems before they occur
- **Design:** Designing solutions that are less likely to fail
- **Process improvement:** Identifying areas for improvement in a process"
