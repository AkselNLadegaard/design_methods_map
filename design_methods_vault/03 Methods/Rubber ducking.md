## Description
**Rubber ducking**, also known as rubber duck debugging, is a **self-teaching** technique where you **explain your problem or code line-by-line to an inanimate object**, like a rubber duck. By verbalizing your thought process, you often **identify the solution yourself** through the act of **articulation and clear explanation**.

## Examples 
- A programmer explains their code line-by-line to a rubber duck, realizing a logical error in the process.
- A writer discusses their story plot with a stuffed animal, gaining clarity and identifying inconsistencies.
- A designer sketches their ideas while talking them out loud, uncovering new possibilities and flaws.
