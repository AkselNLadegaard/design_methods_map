## Description
~~Just like have some ideas and write them down.~~
Structured ideation sessions, with a lot of flexibility and history, there has been a lot of development of different brainstorming techniques with different pros and cons.

- You can ideate both problems, solutions, principles and concepts. 
- Quantity over quality - filter out the bad ideas later with other methods 
- Facilitation is key! 
- Avoid too much [[Priming]] 
- Ensure that everyone can participate equally 


1. [[Round robin brainstorming]] where each participant shares an idea in sequence to avoid dominance of  a few individuals.
2. [[Rapid ideation]] where participants are given a very short time to ideate 
3. [[Figurestorming]] where visual representaitons are use, be it drawings, figures or Lego
4. [[Step ladder brainstorming]] where participants build on each others ideas. Make it a tree so you don't get stuck on the roof ;)
5. [[Mind Mapping]] where you connect and relate ideas, sketch and otherwise visualise and make your brainstorming more appealing 
6. [[Starbursting]] where you systematically try to explore 6ish ideas around each idea - especially good to ensure you cover an entire domain
