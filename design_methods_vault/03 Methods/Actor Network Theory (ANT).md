## Description
Actor-network theory (ANT) is a sociological approach that views the world as a network of interconnected actors, including humans, non-human objects, concepts, and ideas. ANT emphasizes the active role of non-human actors in shaping social processes, challenging the traditional distinction between humans and technology.  #notebook/ai/google/bard

## Key points
- Non humans have agency, e.g., Technology is an agent, and is not passive
	- Inherently linked to [[Socio-Technical systems]]
- Agency and power in a network is distributed across agents
- Be reflective of your own biases and (potential) placement in the network
- Designing for change and in a changing context
